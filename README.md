# Northcoders News

Northcoders News is a front-end project designed to offer seamless access to application data programmatically. Its main goal is to simulate the creation of a functional backend service similar to Reddit, enabling essential features like browsing and categorizing articles by topic. It also supports user interactions, such as logging in, commenting, and voting on articles. This project utilizes the Northcoders News API backend, which I developed, showcasing practical full-stack development skills. Building an application that mimics the complex functionalities of a platform like Reddit presents numerous learning opportunities and challenges. Ensuring effective and smooth communication between the frontend and backend components is vital for providing a seamless user experience, especially for a project of this scale.
